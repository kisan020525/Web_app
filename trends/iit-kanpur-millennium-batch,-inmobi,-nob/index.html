                <strong>⚡ Quick Summary:</strong>
                <ul style="margin: 10px 0 0 20px; padding: 0;">
                    <li>IIT Kanpur's Millennium Batch alumni are launching a new Rs 100 crore school.</li>
                    <li>The institution will focus on the intersection of technology and societal impact.</li>
                    <li>Founders of InMobi and NoBroker are among the key backers.</li>
                    <li>The initiative aims to bridge the gap between technological advancement and social responsibility.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>In a significant move set to shape the future discourse on technology's role in society, a formidable group of alumni from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur's 2000-2004 batch has pooled resources to launch a new academic initiative. The project, tentatively named the 'School for Technology and Society,' has secured an initial funding commitment of Rs 100 crore.</p>

            <p>Leading the charge are prominent figures from India's tech startup ecosystem, including Naveen Tewari, co-founder and CEO of InMobi, and Amit Agarwal, co-founder and CEO of NoBroker. Their involvement underscores a growing recognition among tech leaders about the critical need to address the complex societal implications of rapidly evolving technologies.</p>

            <h2>Bridging the Tech Divide</h2>
            <p>The proposed school aims to foster interdisciplinary research and education at the nexus of artificial intelligence, biotechnology, climate tech, and other frontier technologies, with a strong emphasis on their ethical, economic, and social consequences. Unlike traditional engineering or social science programs, this institution will reportedly encourage a holistic understanding, equipping future leaders with the foresight to build technology that benefits humanity.</p>

            <p>"The pace of technological change is unprecedented," stated a spokesperson close to the initiative, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It's imperative that we develop frameworks and cultivate minds that can not only innovate but also anticipate and mitigate potential societal risks. This school is envisioned as a think tank and an educational hub for precisely that."</p>

            <h2>Curriculum and Vision</h2>
            <p>While specific curriculum details are still under wraps, sources suggest that the school will offer postgraduate programs, executive education, and short-term courses designed for technologists, policymakers, and social entrepreneurs. The focus will be on areas such as AI ethics, digital governance, sustainable technology adoption, and the future of work in an increasingly automated world.</p>

            <p>The selection of IIT Kanpur as the institutional home for this initiative is strategic. The institute has a strong track record in producing engineering talent and has been increasingly focusing on interdisciplinary research. The "Millennium Batch" alumni, having witnessed and contributed to the digital revolution firsthand, bring a unique perspective to the table.</p>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>
            <p>The Rs 100 crore pledge is expected to cover the initial setup costs, faculty recruitment, research grants, and the development of a dedicated campus or research facility. The founders are reportedly in discussions with IIT Kanpur for a suitable operational model, which could involve an independent entity or a specialized center within the institute.</p>

            <p>This venture represents a significant philanthropic effort by the tech elite, signaling a maturing phase in India's startup ecosystem where the focus is shifting from rapid growth to responsible innovation. The success of the School for Technology and Society could set a precedent for similar institutions globally, highlighting the critical importance of aligning technological progress with societal well-being.</p>
